Q. How do you start YAMN remailer daemon automatically at boot time?

Become root, or sudo user.

Add a file called /etc/systemd/system/yamn.service that contains the following:

===========
# /etc/systemd/system/yamn.service

[Unit]
Description=YAMN Anonymous Remailer
After=mail-transport-agent.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=yamn
Group=yamn
ExecStart=/home/yamn/yamn/yamn -M -D
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

============

Save the file.

chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/yamn.service

Then run:

systemctl enable yamn

Reboot your VPS. This is not essential but is a good way
to confirm that the service works as intended.

If you prefer not to reboot at this time then:

systemctl start yamn
