# sac001.github.io

Please note, this little website has a .well-known folder,
containing an OpenPGP Web Key Directory (WKD) and a Braver
Browser verification code. So, if you are a Brave user you
know then that this site belongs to me.

Regarding hosting WKD on GitHub, I strongly suggest to read
my thread 'WKD for GitHub pages', which I started a while
ago on the GnuPG Mailing List, to see why WKD does not work
with GnuPG and github.io pages, but with sequoia-pgp,
Mailvelope, FlowCrypt and the latest Thunderbird etc.

As a test, so you can try out fetching two demo pub keys,
I included here alice@sac001.github.io and bob@sac001.github.io.

These two pub keys are meant as universal OpenPGP pub keys, so
that WKD users do not have to reveal their real email address
and can use such universal pub keys als for other channels
and tasks, besides email.
